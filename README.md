# SimpleMVI
Simple implementation of MVI Architecture on Android allowing you to understand how Networking, Caching Data flow should look in this pattern also i would try to add the latest libraries and sample of usage.

# Recommended Architecture implementation to go forward

- MVI CORE BADOO - https://github.com/badoo/MVICore
- MVI Kotlin - https://github.com/arkivanov/MVIKotlin

Take your time with these two architectures since they are quite good to be used in production and also it might not fit the best with every project, team and organization.
